Computer Vision library for JavaScript
--------------------------------------

This repository contains a computer vision library for JavaScript. Its API was inspired by OpenCV. In addition a Reactive version is included which was inspired by [Bonsai](https://bitbucket.org/horizongir/bonsai).

The original intent was to create an execution environment which allows Bonsai workflows to execute within the browser.
